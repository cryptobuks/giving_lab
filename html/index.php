        <h1>GiftCoin</h1>
        <p>A GiftCoin is a token that represents a fixed-value donation to charity. The recipient chooses where their donation will go at the GiftCoin website.</p>
         
        <p>GiftCoins can be distributed as a code which recipients redeem by typing it in at the website, or a 3D-printed physical coin, which they can scan with a smartphone.</p>
        
        <p>GiftCoins are intended to be used as an incentive where money is not appropriate. As a thank you to a customer, or to persuade someone to do a survey or give feedback...</p>
        
        <p>... in the same way that bottle of wine is sometimes an appropriate gift, but a Â£5 note isn't.</p>
