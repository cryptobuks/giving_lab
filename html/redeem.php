        <h1>Redemption User Journey</h1>
        
        <p>Once a company has purchased the GiftCoins, they can give them to people as a reward or incentive.</p>
        
        <p>Those people come to the website to make their donation.</p>
        
        <p>If a recipient has a code, they simply type it into the front page of the website</p>
        
        <p>If they have a physical coin, they could either scan the QR code, or go to a unique URL, as printed on the other side of the coin.</p> 
        
        <p>Facebook authentication provides  get age, sex and location data, which is to make personalised charity recommendations, as well as suggesting popular choices.</p>
        
        <p>Alternatively, the user could post to their FB page asking for suggestions - asking the question gives permission to brag about your donation.</p>
